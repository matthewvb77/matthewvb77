### Hi, I'm Matt Van Brummelen ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in startups, fullstack, and backend development. My last project was BuzzCode ([Marketplace link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BuzzCode.buzzcode)) and now I'm developing software for online education. I'm on the lookout for a role in backend with Go/Python or fullstack development; if you're hiring, let's chat!
