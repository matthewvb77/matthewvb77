### Hi, I'm Matt Van Brummelen ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in startups, fullstack, and backend development. My last project was [BuzzCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BuzzCode.buzzcode) and now I'm building [Ember Education](https://ember.ac), a course-builder that lets you sell courses (and promote Udemy courses) on your own site. I'm on the lookout for a full-stack role or backend with Go or Python; if you're hiring, let's chat!
