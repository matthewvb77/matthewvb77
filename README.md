### Hi, I'm Matt Van Brummelen ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in startups and fullstack development. My last project was BuzzCode ([Marketplace link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BuzzCode.buzzcode)) and now starting to explore making software for online education. I'm currently on the look out for a role in fullstack development; if you're hiring, let's chat!
